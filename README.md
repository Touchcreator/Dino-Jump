Really just testing pygame, maybe this will be good? Who knows?

#### How to Play:
**Step 1:** Install at least Python 3.8. (That's the version I tested it on) 
**Step 2:** Install the pygame library with `pip install pygame`.
**Step 3:** Clone the repository onto your machine.
**Step 4:** Double click the `main.py` file and enjoy!

## To Do:
